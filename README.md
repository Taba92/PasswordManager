For the login it is used the loginWindow application : https://github.com/Taba92/loginWindow

CONFIGURATION:
    Launch the script **install**, that will create a default user *root* with password *passwd1111111111*.
    It also creates the default storage for the *root* user.

ATTENTION:
    ***Every invocation of the configuration script install, remove all files in Credentials and Passwords folders and recreate the default user***.

***The passwords storage is encrypted with the credentials of the logged user, so it very important to change as soon as possible the default user with other login credentials***.
